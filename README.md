# GTA V on iPhone (5★ Port)

> [!TIP]
> **🆕 New in v1.2: build the app right from your iPhone, no computer needed.**
> Open **[fivestarport.vercel.app](https://fivestarport.vercel.app)**, sign in with GitHub, pick three files, and about 25 minutes later your app is ready to install. Free.

A fan project that runs the WebAssembly build of GTA V natively on iPhone: the engine compiled to ARM64, a native Metal renderer with every shader precompiled, Story mode or free-roam Sandbox, touch controls that act as a real controller (with the game's own aim assist), gyro aiming, tilt steering and graphics presets up to near-native resolution.

**This repository contains no game files and no game code.** You need your own copy of the game files. The app is built from them in your own GitHub account (or on your own Mac), and it plays from your own copy on your phone.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **Your own game files** | Web build `8b0b5899ed`: the folder that contains `data/` and `b/8b0b5899ed/`, about 21 GB. |
| **An iPhone with 6 GB of memory** | iPhone 12 Pro, 13 Pro, any iPhone 14 or newer, on iOS 17 or later, with about 30 GB free. Older 4 GB iPhones will most likely run out of memory. |
| **A GitHub account** (free) | It builds the app for you. No card needed. |
| **SideStore or AltStore** (free) | Installs the app with your normal Apple ID. Setting it up needs a computer once (an Apple rule). [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) · [AltStore](https://altstore.io) |

No paid Apple account is needed.

## Install in 4 steps

### 1. Put your game files on your iPhone

Copy your game folder (the one with `data/` and `b/` inside) onto the iPhone, so it sits in the Files app under **On My iPhone**. Not iCloud Drive: iCloud can offload files to save space, and the game needs every file on the phone.

Any way that gets the folder there works, for example:
- **AirDrop** it from a Mac, or download and unzip it in the Files app.
- **With a cable**, once the app is installed (step 3): Finder on a Mac, or the Apple Devices app on Windows. Select your iPhone, open **Files**, and drag the folder onto **GTA V Port**. It then shows up in Files under On My iPhone › GTA V Port.

### 2. Build your app with 5★ Port Builder

Open **[fivestarport.vercel.app](https://fivestarport.vercel.app)** on your iPhone and follow the steps:
1. **Connect GitHub.** The builder makes a private copy of this repository in your account. GitHub asks you to approve it once; keep "All repositories" selected.
2. **Pick three files** from your game folder:
   - `b/8b0b5899ed/game.wasm`
   - `shaders.zip`: in Files, open `b/8b0b5899ed`, long-press the `shaders` folder and tap **Compress**, then pick the zip.
   - `data/manifest.json`
3. **Upload and build.** About 85 MB goes to your own private repository; the big `data` folder stays on your phone. GitHub then builds the app in about 25 minutes. You can close the page and come back later.

When it's done, tap **Download my app** to get `GTA5Port.ipa`. It also stays in your GitHub account, under your repository's Releases.

### 3. Install it

Open **SideStore** or **AltStore**, go to **My Apps**, tap **+** and pick `GTA5Port.ipa`. A free Apple ID re-signs the app every 7 days; SideStore does that on the phone, and AltStore does it over Wi-Fi from your computer.

### 4. Give the app your game files and play

**Easiest:** open the app once, then in the Files app long-press your game folder, tap **Move**, and choose **On My iPhone › GTA V Port**. Moving within On My iPhone is instant. Open the app again: it finds the game by itself, at any depth (a `mirror/playgta5.com/…` folder works as is).

**Or pick it:** in the app tap **Game files › Pick a folder on this iPhone** and tap **Open** while you are *in* the folder that has `data` and `b` inside (or any folder above it). Not inside `b` or `data`.

Then choose **Story mode** (the campaign, with saves) or **Sandbox** (free roam) and press **Play**.

Everything plays from your phone: no server, no internet needed while playing.

## Tips

- **Graphics.** Settings has six presets, from Battery to Max, and a separate resolution choice that changes while you play. Presets above the recommended one show a warning. If a setting needs more memory than your iPhone gives the app, the game closes; on the next launch the app tells you and goes back to a setting that works. Settings that already ran fine on your phone are never lowered.
- **Something went wrong?** Settings › **Send log to the developer** sends this run's log and the previous one (the one from a crash) in one tap. **Share log** lets you save or send it yourself.
- **Controls.** Move, resize or hide every touch button with **Edit controls layout** (start screen or Settings). Assisted aim, gyro aiming and tilt steering are in Settings. Bluetooth controllers work too; the touch controls hide while one is connected.
- **Updating.** When a new version comes out, open the builder again and tap **Build again**. Your game folder and saves stay where they are.

## Get the most performance

The biggest upgrade is **more memory**: iOS normally gives the app about half of your iPhone's RAM, which caps the graphics. You can unlock more, for free:

### Unlock more memory with SideStore + GetMoreRam (free)

Players report this works great and makes the game far more playable.

1. On [fivestarport.vercel.app](https://fivestarport.vercel.app), tick **Enable increased memory entitlements** before tapping Upload and build (already built? tick it and tap **Build again**).
2. Install the new `GTA5Port.ipa` with **SideStore** as usual.
3. Install **[GetMoreRam](https://github.com/hugeBlack/GetMoreRam)**, sign in with the **same Apple ID** you use in SideStore, pick **GTA V Port** and add **Increased Memory Limit**.
4. In SideStore, **refresh** GTA V Port so it picks up the change.
5. Open the app: **Settings** shows the memory limit at the bottom. It should now be clearly higher than before (for example above ~3,500 MB on a 6 GB iPhone).

A paid Apple developer account or TrollStore gets you the same result without GetMoreRam (see *Free vs paid* below).

### Then tune the game

- **Graphics preset:** with more memory, try one step higher (Balanced, Quality, Ultra). If a preset is too much, the app tells you on the next launch and steps back down, so trying is safe.
- **Resolution:** set it separately in Settings while you play. It's the main lever for sharpness vs. frame rate.
- **Frame rate:** Settings › Frame rate: **30** is steadiest and coolest, **60** is smoother, **Unlocked** goes up to 120 on ProMotion iPhones (13 Pro and newer Pro models). Applies at the next launch.
- **Keep it cool:** iPhones slow down when hot. Play without a case or near airflow, and avoid charging while playing if it gets warm.
- **Close other apps** before playing and keep **Low Power Mode off**.
- **Game files on the iPhone:** keep the game folder in *On My iPhone*, not iCloud Drive (iCloud can offload files and cause loading stutters).

## Other ways to build (advanced)

The builder above is the easiest route. These older routes still work.

### On your own Mac

Needs an Apple Silicon Mac with Xcode (free) and `brew install xcodegen`. Point the script at your game folder:

```sh
./build_ipa.sh --mirror /path/to/your/game-folder          # free Apple ID
./build_ipa.sh --mirror /path/to/your/game-folder --paid   # paid developer account
```

This makes `GTA5Port.ipa` next to the script (about 30 to 60 minutes); install it with SideStore or AltStore. To install straight from Xcode instead, open `app/PlayGTA5Native.xcodeproj` (created by the script), choose your iPhone as the destination, pick your Apple ID under **Signing & Capabilities** (free accounts appear as *Personal Team*; change the bundle identifier to something unique if Xcode asks), and press **Run**.

### With GitHub Actions yourself, streaming from your computer

The original v1.0 route: your computer serves the game files over [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (free), GitHub builds from them, and the app streams the files while you play. Useful if you don't want 21 GB on your phone.

[![The v1.0 setup video (streaming route)](docs/video-thumbnail.jpg)](https://github.com/kevinerikjs/gta5-ios-port/releases/download/v1.0/gta5-ios-port-tutorial.mp4)

*The 70-second v1.0 setup video for this route.*

**Serve your game files**
1. Install Tailscale on your computer and phone and sign in to the same account on both.
2. In the Tailscale admin console, under **DNS**, turn on **MagicDNS** and **HTTPS Certificates**.
3. On the computer, share the game folder (the one containing `data/` and `b/`):
   ```sh
   tailscale serve --bg "/path/to/your/game-files"
   ```
4. Run `tailscale serve status`. It shows your server address, like `https://my-pc.tailnet-name.ts.net`. Open `https://my-pc.tailnet-name.ts.net/data/manifest.json` in Safari on your phone; if you see text, it works.

Only devices on your own tailnet can reach it. To stop sharing: `tailscale serve --https=443 off`.

**Build**
1. On this repository's page, press **Use this template** › **Create a new repository**, and choose **Private**. The build refuses to run in a public copy, because the finished app contains the game engine from your files.
2. In the Tailscale admin console: **Settings › Keys › Generate auth key**. Turn on **Reusable** and **Ephemeral**, pick a short expiry such as 7 days, and copy the key.
3. In your new repository: **Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions › New repository secret**. Add `TS_AUTHKEY` (the key) and `GAME_SERVER_URL` (your server address, e.g. `https://my-pc.tailnet-name.ts.net`).
4. **Actions › Build my IPA › Run workflow**, with game files set to **my server (Tailscale)**. Tick *paid account* only if you have one.
5. After about 25 minutes, download `GTA5Port.ipa` from your repository's **Releases** (or the run's artifacts).

A Mac works for this route too: `./build_ipa.sh https://my-pc.tailnet-name.ts.net`.

**Play.** Keep Tailscale connected; the app opens with your server filled in. The first launch downloads about 4 GB into the app; later launches start much faster. Settings › Game files › **Download all game files** copies the whole game (about 21 GB) onto the phone so it stops streaming.

### Build minutes and billing

Private repositories get free GitHub Actions minutes every month (2,000 on the free plan). Mac minutes count ten times, so one 25-minute build uses about 250 of them: roughly eight builds a month for free. GitHub only charges if you raise your spending limit above zero. If your account has an old billing problem, every run fails instantly with *startup_failure*; fix it in GitHub's billing settings.

## Free vs paid Apple account

| | Free Apple ID | Paid Apple Developer account (99 USD/year) |
|---|---|---|
| Works | yes | yes |
| Memory iOS allows the app | normal limit (about 3,000 MB on a 6 GB iPhone) | *Increased Memory Limit* + *Extended Virtual Addressing* (about 4,000 MB) |
| Experience | smooth on the lighter presets: about 25 to 31 FPS on an iPhone 13 Pro Max | the same, plus room for higher presets |
| Re-sign | every 7 days | once a year |

Settings shows the memory limit iOS gave the app at the bottom.

**Using a paid account:** tick *Enable increased memory entitlements* in the builder or use `--paid` on a Mac, then sign with your paid team. On a Mac (most reliable): open `app/PlayGTA5Native.xcodeproj`, pick your paid team under **Signing & Capabilities**, change the bundle identifier to something unique (e.g. `com.yourname.gta5port`), check that **Increased Memory Limit** and **Extended Virtual Addressing** are listed, choose your iPhone and press **Run**. If an IPA signed by SideStore or AltStore with a paid Apple ID shows the free limit, the tool dropped the entitlements; use the Mac route.

## How it works

- The engine (`game.wasm` from your files) is translated to C with [wasm2c](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) and compiled to ARM64 at build time; iOS does not allow compiling code on the phone.
- Graphics use this project's own Metal renderer (`app/Source/MetalRenderer`). It runs the game's Direct3D 11-style command stream directly on Metal. At build time, the game's shaders from your files are translated to Metal with `app/ShaderTool` (built on Google's [Tint](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn), BSD-3-Clause/Apache-2.0, prebuilt in this project's releases) and precompiled into the app, so nothing is compiled on the phone while you play.
- Touch input feeds the engine's own controller code, so GTA's controller features (assisted aim, analog driving) work.
- Game files are read straight from the folder on your phone, or streamed from your server into a block cache.
- The website builder runs in your browser with your own GitHub sign-in: it uploads the three build files to your private repository and starts this repository's workflow there. Its server stores nothing.
